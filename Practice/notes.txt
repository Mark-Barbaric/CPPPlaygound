runtime polymorphism


- virtual functions
- function overriding

compile time polymorphism

having different arguments or signatures and different return types

the definition of functions and their calls is determined at compile time
early binding

-function overloading: function can have different number of parameters and types which are resolved at compile time
-operator overloading: developers can change behavior of operators for 

t is less preferred for handling complex problems since all the methods and details come to light only during the compile time. Hence, debugging becomes tougher.

what operators can't you overload

- scope operator ::
- dot operator .
- ternary operator ?
- sizeof

runtime polymorphism

This type of polymorphism is executed through virtual functions and function overridin

lvalue vs rvalue

lvalues is an object reference, variable name, dereferenced pointer
rvalue is value

"this" keyword

- pointer to instance of class


new vs malloc

memory allocation is the same, malloc doesn't call the constructor
malloc is just a pointer

similar to delete and free
need to call delete operator which calls free

delete calls destructor

what is an inline function

compilers puts the function code wherever the function is used during compile time
all methods defined in headers and implicitly inlined

Inline functions are best used for small functions such as accessing private data members. 

What is a pointer?

a variable that stores the memory address as its value

What is a reference

similar to a pointer except the memory address of a reference can't be changed.
